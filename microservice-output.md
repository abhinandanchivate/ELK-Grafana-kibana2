Here are some sample outputs for the **Product Service** and **Order Service** based on the provided implementation.

---

### **1. Product Service Sample Outputs**

#### **Request 1: Fetch All Products**

**Command:**
```sh
curl http://localhost:8081/products
```

**Expected Response (HTTP 200 OK):**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Laptop",
    "price": 1000.0
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Smartphone",
    "price": 500.0
  }
]
```

---

#### **Request 2: Fetch Product by ID (Valid ID)**

**Command:**
```sh
curl http://localhost:8081/product/1
```

**Expected Response (HTTP 200 OK):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Laptop",
  "price": 1000.0
}
```

---

#### **Request 3: Fetch Product by ID (Invalid ID)**

**Command:**
```sh
curl http://localhost:8081/product/99
```

**Expected Response (HTTP 404 Not Found):**
```json
"Product Not Found"
```

---

#### **Request 4: When Circuit Breaker Opens (Simulated Failure Condition)**

**Command:**
```sh
curl http://localhost:8081/products
```

**Simulated Scenario:** If the backend API fails or becomes slow for multiple requests.

**Expected Response (HTTP 503 Service Unavailable):**
```json
{
  "error": "Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."
}
```

---

### **2. Order Service Sample Outputs**

#### **Request 1: Fetch All Orders**

**Command:**
```sh
curl http://localhost:8082/orders
```

**Expected Response (HTTP 200 OK):**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "product": "Laptop",
    "quantity": 1,
    "price": 1000.0
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "product": "Phone",
    "quantity": 2,
    "price": 500.0
  }
]
```

---

#### **Request 2: Fetch Order by ID (Valid ID)**

**Command:**
```sh
curl http://localhost:8082/order/1
```

**Expected Response (HTTP 200 OK):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "product": "Laptop",
  "quantity": 1,
  "price": 1000.0
}
```

---

#### **Request 3: Fetch Order by ID (Invalid ID)**

**Command:**
```sh
curl http://localhost:8082/order/99
```

**Expected Response (HTTP 404 Not Found):**
```json
"Order Not Found"
```

---

#### **Request 4: Retry Mechanism Example (Simulated Failure and Retry Success)**

**Command:**
```sh
curl http://localhost:8082/orders
```

**Scenario:** The first few requests to the database fail, and the retry mechanism allows it to succeed later.

**Expected Response (after retries):**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "product": "Laptop",
    "quantity": 1,
    "price": 1000.0
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "product": "Phone",
    "quantity": 2,
    "price": 500.0
  }
]
```

If retry attempts are exhausted:

**Expected Response (HTTP 500 Internal Server Error):**
```json
{
  "error": "Service is currently unavailable. Please try later."
}
```

### **3. Consul Service Discovery Verification**

#### **Request 1: Check Registered Services**

**Command:**
```sh
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/agent/services
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "product-service": {
    "ID": "product-service",
    "Service": "product-service",
    "Tags": ["ktor", "product"],
    "Address": "localhost",
    "Port": 8081
  },
  "order-service": {
    "ID": "order-service",
    "Service": "order-service",
    "Tags": ["ktor", "order"],
    "Address": "localhost",
    "Port": 8082
  }
}
```

---

### **4. Docker Compose Logs for Services**

Run the following command to check the logs for all services:

```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

**Expected Output (Logs):**
```
product-service    | Registering with Consul...
product-service    | Application started on port 8081
order-service      | Registering with Consul...
order-service      | Application started on port 8082
consul             | Agent started: http://0.0.0.0:8500
postgres           | Database ready for connections
```

### **5. Edge Case Scenarios to Test**

| Scenario                          | Expected Behavior                                                 |
|---------------------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Invalid Endpoint Access           | `404 Not Found` error                                             |
| High Traffic Load                 | Circuit breaker activation, returning `503` after threshold      |
| Database Down                      | Retry mechanism kicks in, then `500` error if all retries fail    |
| Consul Service Failure             | Microservices continue to function with fallback logic            |
| Slow API Response                  | Circuit breaker trips and fails fast after a set timeout          |
